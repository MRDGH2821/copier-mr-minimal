## Date

2026-01-14

## Prompt

> add a point that whatevery is done using AI should be documented in `.ai` folder in markdown folder.
>
> It should include the prompt, what was done and which model did it.

## What Was Done

Added a new subsection "AI-Assisted Work Documentation" to the `AGENTS.md` file under the "General Guidelines" section. This addition establishes the requirement that all AI-assisted work should be documented in the `.ai` folder.

### Changes Made

1. Created new subsection titled "AI-Assisted Work Documentation"
2. Specified three required elements for AI documentation:
   - The prompt or request that initiated the work
   - Description of what was done
   - Which AI model was used
3. Added context explaining the purpose: transparency and tracking AI contributions

### Files Modified

- `AGENTS.md` - Added documentation requirements with folder structure and naming convention

### Additional Actions

- Created the `.ai/logs` directory to house AI-assisted work logs
- Created this documentation file as the first example of the new practice
- Established naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format for log files

## Notes

This change establishes a best practice for the template repository, ensuring that all AI contributions are tracked and transparent. This is particularly valuable for:

- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Reviewing AI-suggested changes
- Learning from AI assistance patterns
- Maintaining accountability and transparency

### Prompt

> add this point: if more prompts were provided, it should be appended to the logged document, with timestamp.

### What Was Done

Updated the AI-Assisted Work Documentation section in `AGENTS.md` to include the requirement that multiple prompts on the same day should be appended to the existing log file with timestamps.

### Changes Made

- Added bullet point: "If more prompts are provided on the same day, append them to the existing log file with timestamps"
- This clarifies that we maintain one log file per day with multiple entries when needed

### Prompt

> As for timestamp, use `date` command to add it.
> Add it in @AGENTS.md file as a point

### What Was Done

Updated the AI-Assisted Work Documentation section in `AGENTS.md` to specify using the `date` command for generating timestamps in log files.

### Changes Made

- Added bullet point: "Use the `date` command to generate timestamps (e.g., `date --iso-8601=seconds` or `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`)"
- Updated all timestamps in this log file to use ISO 8601 format from `date --iso-8601=seconds`
- This ensures consistent, precise timestamps across all AI documentation logs
